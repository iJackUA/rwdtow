This guide is born after a question "Could you write a list of all the things, that a good Ruby on Rails developer should know?". I decided to expand it to the whole of Ruby web development and related “Full Stack” skills (but also limit it to "Web", as it is not about Ruby in general).

It is inspired by ["PHP The Right Way"](http://www.phptherightway.com/) guide. The format and advises. This guide also contains sections dedicated to very important aspects of web development, explanation (if needed) and list of tutorial links.

Sometimes I will suggest tools or gems (with comparison if possible), but these are merely suggestions to get you started. It is up to you, the reader, to decide whether you would like to use them or not.

> Important notice. All suggestions in this guide are my personal opinion. They do not represent absolute truth or generally-accepted best practices. My goal is simply to make suggestions based on my experience.

> This guide is not complete tutorial - clear steps like installing Ruby (via `rbenv` or `rvm`), managing dependencies via Bundler, etc. are not described due to the wide coverage of these aspects in other tutorials. I do not mention it if I do not know any issues regarding a particular aspect, if it works – that's fine.

## Why not "Ruby On Rails" and not "The Right Way"?
I am glad you are asking! :)  
It is not a secret that most Ruby web developers are introduced to Ruby via Rails. This is a double-edged sword. It lowers the barrier to entry, but it also narrows the range of knowledge. This guide contains a special Ruby on Rails section to cover Rails-specific things, and hopefully it will encourage you to look outside of Rails and the “Rails Way”. I can't call the way described here as "The Right Way" as it is just another way to look at Ruby web development.

## Manifesto

* prefer simple solutions
* configuration over confusion
