Everybody knows that you should use Rake task to run some code in CLI. But we also need to understand that Rake is not something that comes by default from "Rails". It is external tool and ideally it also should be a matter of consideration to use it or not. Main downside of Rake task is that is hard to test (due to DSL nature it requires some special initialization). You should be very careful while putting some business logic in Rake tasks. It is considered is harmful, as putting logic inside web frameworks Controller.

As with any other tool Rake is not limited to `namespace`, `task` and `desk` - you should learn how to use all benefits and functionality hidden inside. Try to look into advanced Rake docs. 

Also we need to understand that there are much cleaner alternatives like Thor. That provides the same functionality to simplify writing own CLI tools, but do it in much cleaner OOP way.
