# Deployment and Server

TODO

* [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/)

Alternative solutions like Mina do not have any major advantages at the moment.
Or a custom Deploy workflow for big projects with tools like Ansible

### VPS, Dedicated server

### Protect non-production servers with HTTP Auth

Basic Auth could be used as the main form of authentication for very simple apps, or admin backends. It is often used to prevent access to staging servers by strangers and search engines (to prevent indexing of non-production pages).

In Rails, the simplest basic auth could be added like this:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  http_basic_authenticate_with name: "admin", password: "hunter2"
end
```

More advanced ways can be found in the [Rails docs](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/HttpAuthentication/Basic.html).

In any other Rack based server, you can use the `Rack::Auth::Basic` middleware:

```ruby
use Rack::Auth::Basic, "Restricted Area" do |username, password|
  [username, password] == ['admin', 'pass']
end
```
