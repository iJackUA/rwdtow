# Document your code

Code documentation is more than just writing human-readable code comments. It is also about creating functional comments in specific formats (like RDoc or YARDOC) that are clear to other developers, and that can be interpreted by your IDE.

* [RDoc](http://docs.seattlerb.org/rdoc/)
* [YARDOC](http://yardoc.org/)

Remember that this documentation can help your IDE to make correct autocompletions of returned values, and object attributes/methods.
