# Debug

Many people are creating a lot of apps without using even standard debugging technics. We tend to stay a "puts debuggerers" because it is easy, stable and "for sure". But we loose troubleshooting productivity a lot without a good debugging skills. First step is to discover Pry `binding.pry` and Byebug `byebug` debuggers. They allow you to set a breakpoint, stop app execution there and make a print of current variables stack. But debugging is not limited by it. The next step is learn how to walk step-by-step inside the app. Step into functions etc.

Great results could be achieved while combining both these solutions in [pry-byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/pry-byebug). Great PRY capabilities with navigations (step and callstack) from Byebug.

The best debugging experience could be provided via visual debugger like in IntelliJ RubyMine IDE. It is based on additional Gem and require to tun our app via this Gem launcher. But as a result you an set breakpoints ring in your IDE and walk through you code inside IDE. While seeing all variables stack on each step. Such a high density of visual debug info can dramatically increase productivity and decrease time to track an error.
