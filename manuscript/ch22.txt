# Style guide and style checker

While Ruby does not have a lot of curly brackets `{}`, code style issues are not so sharp as in languages like PHP. But in any case, we can write code with different paddings, spaces, and line breaks. To avoid confusion and continuous fixes in your team code - you should adopt some style guide. All team members should be agreed and follow it.

Also, there are tools like RuboCop that can make automatic static code analysis and propose fixes or recommendations.
