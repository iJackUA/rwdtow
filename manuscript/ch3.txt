# Ground knowledge

## Web
It is a shame that many developers do not understand the fundamentals of web development. We are creating web apps without even knowing how the Internet (or the web) works. That is why junior developers do not understand where params come from, and the difference between HTTP request methods. Unfortunately, this lays the groundwork for reliance upon "magic."

If you feel confident in your basic web knowledge and want to dive deeper in all aspects, read the free ebook [High-Performance Browser Networking](https://hpbn.co/).

>This book provides a hands-on overview of what every web developer needs to know about the various types of networks (WiFi, 3G/4G), transport protocols (UDP, TCP, and TLS), application protocols (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2), and APIs available in the browser (XHR, WebSocket, WebRTC, and more) to deliver the best—fast, reliable, and resilient—user experience.

## Linux
A lot of us come to web development with Windows desktops. But even if Ruby can be installed on Windows, I recommend using a Linux machine for Ruby development – either a real desktop OS setup, or a virtual machine – because the world of web servers (VPS) is all about Linux. You must have a good understanding of Linux to do basic performance tuning and advanced web server setup for your applications in production.
This requires being familiar with at least one Linux distribution – Ubuntu, for example, or one of the other top 10 distros.

## IDE
You can write Ruby code in any text editor, but using a more sophisticated IDE increases productivity.

Editors like SublimeText and Atom require some additional plugin setup

The most full-featured IDE is RubyMine, but it is not free.
Due to the dynamic nature of Ruby, it is hard for IDEs to do correct autocompletion most of the time. This is why RubyMine is not as powerful as similar IDEs for other languages, but it still provides quite a lot of additional integrated tools.
